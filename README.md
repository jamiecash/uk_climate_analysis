Analysis of UK MET office station readings to answer questions on climate change.

# Introduction
Living in the UK and remembering childhood winters playing in the snow, it often *feels* like the climate has changed notably since these memories around 35 years ago. The last time I remember my own children playing in the snow was several years ago at Easter. They built an Easter Bunny Snowman rather than the typical kind that I remember building as a child around Christmas.

My news feeds are filled with unprecedented climate related events such as floods and wildfires around the globe. It certainly *appears* to me like the climate has changed rapidly in recent years. But is this just my perception or is there any evidence of this change?

In order to determine how the climate has changed in the UK since my childhood, this project analyses the [Met Office Historical Staton Data](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/climate/maps-and-data/historic-station-data).
